    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. </p>
    <p>The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Guanciale:</strong> Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you canâ€™t find it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong> Use store-bought or <a href="homemadepasta.html">homemade spaghetti noodles</a>. If you like, you can substitute bucatini for the spaghetti.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Three large eggs add richness and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This flavorful spaghetti alla carbonara is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pork in olive oil until browned and crispy, then drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some pepper in a bowl until smooth.</li>

        <li>Stir in the pork, then top with the remaining cheese and more black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
