        <figcaption>Chef John’s spaghetti aglio e olio recipe is pure Italian comfort food. </figcaption>
        <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method.</p>
        <p>The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti: </strong> This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> You’ll need ½ cup of olive oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the spaghetti</li>
            <li>Toast the garlic in olive oil</li>
            <li>Stir the seasonings into the pasta, then stir in the garlic and oil.</li>
            <li>Toss with cheese.</li>
        </ol>
